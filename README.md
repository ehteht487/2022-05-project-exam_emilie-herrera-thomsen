The assignment was to create a web site for a museum called Community Science Museum.

## Description
The task was to build a website for an interactive science museum. The target audience for the website was school children and their families, and also families with younger children. I was provided with the media assets in the form of pictures and images, so the job was to design the website using Adobe XD and then building it and deploying the page on the web.
