Conscious Vegan. 
The assignment was to create a web site containing blog posts made on WordPress.

## Description
The task was to build a website containing a list of blogs made on WordPress. I decided to make a site for vegan recipes. WordPress was used as a headless CMS, and the blog posts were fetched via an API call to the WP API. Some of the posts were displayed on the homepage, and the rest were displayed on a blog spesific page. The assignment was also to create form validation on the contact form. 
PS: I did not finish the site on time, and hence did not deliver the assignment. (I will do a resit)
